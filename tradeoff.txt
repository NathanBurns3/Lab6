A tradeoff that Software Developers often face is readability vs complexity in writing code. this dilemma happens when
a developer is writing code and comes up with a very complex solution but it is very hard to read/understand. When
trying to consider simplifying their code at the cost of it not being as efficient they should consider these factors:

Reusability: The developer should ask themselves how many people will be using/reading this code. If this code is a
key part of the software and a lot of developers will be looking at this code for documentation or other parts of the
software, then they should consider simplifying their solution so that it is easier to understand and reuse for others.

Comments: If the developer is able to leave detailed comments throughout the code that makes it much easier to
understand then they should keep the code how it is. The other developers should be able to read through the comments
and understand how the code works.

Solutions with the same speed/memory usage: If the developer can create other solutions that use the same time
complexity and memory usage then they should consider those solutions. If not then they should consult with others
on if they should sacrifice the readability to keep the complexity and speed/memory usage of their solution.
